# Do not use!!

This was a test repo for me to fill with what I *think* will go in the Meyda
types repo when [this PR]
(https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/41411) is merged.The
idea was to link this package to the package that will consume `@types/meyda`
to verify that it'll work ok. You shouldn't use this directly. Hopefully
`@types/meyda` will be released shortly, and this repo will be completely
obsolete.
